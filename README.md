In this project, I tried to create my own model from scratch without loaded libraries associated with machine learning. She works on the teaching method with the teacher. In the main file, you can set your values ​​for this model and look at the result. 0 - died. 1 - survived.
I fed her great values. And the answer was surprisingly accurate. But the interface and filling were terrible. So, I returned the version easier. But if you are interested in considering a deeper version, then you can write to me in Discord, I will throw you this file. (Discord j2stbob) :3

For those who want to find out how this model works
In short, I explain that we send our data from the date to the first layer, the number of neurons should be similar to the number x for this, which I created support InputLayer. Our neurons are based on linear regression, that is, the model itself was actually created for many known functions y = kx + b. So some weight is formed. It is taken from the class of neurons. And then it just goes through the following layers.

 You can play with existing parameters to resolve the era or take a smaller step, sometimes this happens so that in this case the error begins to occur in the cycles, track the era and make it less, and there is no sense in learning.
